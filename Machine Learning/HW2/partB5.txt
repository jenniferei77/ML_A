The program was able to narrow down the appropriate possible hypotheses into the version space from 65,536 to 32, which is a proportionatly large scale-down. However, the voting for each hypothesis ended up being relatively inaccurate, since the version space predicted that each test input would either be completely high or low, or half high and half low. List-then-Eliminate is also very impractical because you need to search through every possible hypotheses in order to eliminate them one by one. This process becomes incredibly tedious with each new data set added.
