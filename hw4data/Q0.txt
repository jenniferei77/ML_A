A decision tree would work for the political party information, because there are multiple attributes that are not known to affect the affiliation or not. Out of these multiple attributes, there are most likely only a few attributes that actually do accurately tell the user about any party outcome. Since there would only be a few useful attributes out of many unuseful ones, a decision tree would work.

However, a decision tree would not work well for the educational information, since there are so many known attributes that all contribute to the student grades. A collective view of all the attributes are needed in order to arrive at an average grade, so all of them are important and not a single one is probably a tell-tale sign as to if the student gets an A or not. Therefore, a decision tree would not be the best method to use in order to see what grade the student receives.
